Usage: PerfView run CommandAndArgs ...

  Starts data collection, runs a command and stops.

                                         file as an event ever NUM seconds

    [-ForceNgenRundown]                  By default on a V4.0 runtime NGEN rundown is suppressed, because NGEN PDB are a

    [-AcceptEULA]                        Accepts the EULA associated with PerfView.
    [-DataFile:STRING]                   FileName of the profile data to generate.

    [-UnsafePDBMatch]                    Allow the use of PDBs even when the trace does not contain PDB signatures.
    [-ShowUnknownAddresses]              Displays the hexadecimal address rather than ? when the address is unknown.
    [-NoGui]                             Use the Command line version of the command (like on ARM).  Brings up a console
                                         window.  For batch scripts/automation use /LogFile instead (see users guide
                                         under 'Scripting' for more).
    [-SafeMode]                          Turn off parallelism and other risky features.
    [-RestartingToElevelate:STRING]      Internal: indicates that perfView is restarting to get Admin privileges.
    [-SessionName:PerfViewSession]       Define the name for the user mode session, if kernel events are off.
    [-MaxNodeCountK:0]                   The maximum number of objects (in K or thousands) that will even be examined
                                         when dumping the heap.  Avoids memory use at collection time.  This is useful
                                         if heap dumping causes out of memory exceptions.
