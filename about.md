I am **Sebastian Solnica**, a software engineer with more than 15 years of experience. My primary interests are debugging, profiling, and application security. I created this website to share tools and resources that can help you in your diagnostic endeavors. 

I also provide consulting services for troubleshooting .NET applications. If you would like to discuss consulting or contact me for any other reason, please use [the contact form on my blog](https://lowleveldesign.org/about/) or email me at contact@wtrace.net.
