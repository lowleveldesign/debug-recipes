Debug Recipes
=============

It is a repository of my field notes collected while debugging various .NET application problems on Windows (mainly) and Linux. They do not contain much theory but rather describe tools and scripts with some usage examples.

:floppy_disk: Old and no longer updated recipes are in the [archived branch](https://github.com/lowleveldesign/debug-recipes/tree/archive).

The recipes are available in the guides folder and at **[wtrace.net](https://wtrace.net/guides)** (probably the best way to view them).
