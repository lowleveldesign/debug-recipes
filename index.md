## Hello fellow troubleshooters!

I created this site to share guides and tools that I developed during my career as a software developer and troubleshooter. The [**guides**](/guides/) focus on practical techniques, tools, and scripts with usage examples rather than theoretical concepts. I regularly update them with new discoveries and insights.
