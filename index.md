## Hello fellow diagnosers!

I created this site to share with you notes (guides) and tools that I have created during my career as a software developer and troubleshooter. [**Guides**](/guides/) do not contain much theory but rather describe techniques, tools, and scripts with their usage examples. I try to keep them updated with new things I learn and discover.

I hope you will find the materials helpful. Please visit the [about](/about/) page if you wish to contact me.
