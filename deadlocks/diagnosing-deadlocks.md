## Dump collection

There are many tools you may use to collect the memory dump. Below I list the ones I use most often.

### Procdump

To create a full memory dump you may use [procdump](https://live.sysinternals.com):

    procdump -ma <process-name-or-id>

### minidumper (.NET Framework)

[Minidumper](https://github.com/goldshtn/minidumper) is a tool from Sasha Goldshtein (with my contribution). It has options very similar to procdump, but may create more compact memory dumps.

To create a full memory dump, run:

    minidumper -ma <process-name-or-id>

To create a managed heap memory dump, run:

    minidumper -mh <process-name-or-id>

### dotnet-dump (.NET Core)

[dotnet-dump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-dump) is one of the .NET diagnostics CLI tools. You may download it using curl or wget, for example: `curl -JLO https://aka.ms/dotnet-dump/win-x64`.

To create a full memory dump, run one of the commands:

    dotnet-dump collect -p <process-id>
    dotnet-dump collect -n <process-name>

You may create a heap-only memory dump by adding a `--type=Heap` option.

### createdump (.NET Core)

Createdump shares the location with the coreclr library, for example, for .NET 5: `/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/5.0.3/createdump` or `c:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.3\createdump.exe`.

To create a full memory dump, run:

    createdump --full <process-id>

With no options provided, it creates a memory dump with heap, which equals to `createdump --withheap <pid>`

## Analysis

We usually start the analysis by looking at the threads running in a process. The call stacks help us identify blocked threads. In the next step, we need to find the lock objects and relations between threads.

### Listing threads call stacks

To list native stacks for all the threads in **WinDbg**, run: `~*k` or `~*e!dumpstack`. If you are interested only in managed stacks, you may use the `~*e!clrstack` SOS command. There is also a great `!pstacks` command from the [gsose extension](https://github.com/chrisnas/DebuggingExtensions) that groups call stacks for managed threads.

```
0:011> .load gsose.dll
0:011> !pstacks
    ~~~~ 5cd8
       1 System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(Object, Boolean ByRef)
       1 deadlock.Program.Lock2()
    ~~~~ 3e58
       1 System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(Object, Boolean ByRef)
       1 deadlock.Program.Lock1()
  2 System.Threading.Tasks.Task.InnerInvoke()
  ...
  2 System.Threading.ThreadPoolWorkQueue.Dispatch()
  2 System.Threading._ThreadPoolWaitCallback.PerformWaitCallback()
```

In **LLDB**, we may show native call stacks for all the threads with the `bt all` command. Unfortunately, if we want to use `dumpstack` or `clrstack` commands, we need to manually switch between threads with the `thread select` command.

### Finding locks in memory dumps

You may examine thin locks using **!DumpHeap -thinlocks**.  To find all sync blocks, use the **!SyncBlk -all** command.

There are many types of objects that the thread can wait on. You usually see `WaitOnMultipleObjects` on many threads.

If you see `RtlWaitForCriticalSection` it might indicate that the thread is waiting on a critical section. Its adress should be in the call stack. And we may list the critical sections using the `!cs` command. With the -s option, we may examine details of a specific critical section:

    0:033> !cs -s 000000001a496f50
    -----------------------------------------
    Critical section   = 0x000000001a496f50 (+0x1A496F50)
    DebugInfo          = 0x0000000013c9bee0
    LOCKED
    LockCount          = 0x0
    WaiterWoken        = No
    OwningThread       = 0x0000000000001b04
    RecursionCount     = 0x1
    LockSemaphore      = 0x0
    SpinCount          = 0x00000000020007d0

`LockCount` tells you how many threads are currently waiting on a given cs. The `OwningThread` is a thread that owns the cs at the time the command is run. You can easily identify the thread that is waiting on a given cs by issuing `kv` command and looking for critical section identifier in the call parameters.

We can also look for synchronization object handles using the `!handle` command. For example, we may list all the Mutant objects in a process by using the `!handle 0 f Mutant` command.

On .NET Framework, you may also use the **!dlk** command from the SOSEX extension. It is pretty good in detecting deadlocks, example:

```
0:007> .load sosex
0:007> !dlk

```

When debugging locks in code that is using tasks it is often necessary to examine execution contexts assigned to the running threads. I prepared a simple script which lists threads with their execution contexts. You only need (as in previous script) find the MT of the `Thread` class in your appdomain, eg.

```
0:036> !Name2EE mscorlib.dll System.Threading.Thread
Module:      72551000
Assembly:    mscorlib.dll
Token:       020001d1
MethodTable: 72954960
EEClass:     725bc0c4
Name:        System.Threading.Thread
```

And then paste it in the scripts below:

    x86:

    .foreach ($addr {!DumpHeap -short -mt <METHODTABLE> }) { .printf /D "Thread: %i; Execution context: <link cmd=\"!do %p\">%p</link>\n", poi(${$addr}+28), poi(${$addr}+8), poi(${$addr}+8) }

    x64:

    .foreach ($addr {!DumpHeap -short -mt <METHODTABLE> }) { .printf /D "Thread: %i; Execution context: <link cmd=\"!do %p\">%p</link>\n", poi(${$addr}+4c), poi(${$addr}+10), poi(${$addr}+10) }

Notice that the thread number from the output is a managed thread id and to map it to the windbg thread number you need to use the `!Threads` command.

### Find locks in kernel mode

Another command that can be useful here is **!locks**. With **-v** parameter will display all locks accessed by threads in a process.
